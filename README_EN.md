## Features
**1. Select image source**
* You can choose **"Fengyun 4A"** or **"Fengyun 4B"** as the image source
* In the cloud map of Fengyun 4A, the mainland China area is located above the image, the satellite cloud map resolution is not very high, and the overall color tone is reddish
* In the cloud map of Fengyun 4B, the mainland China area is located in the upper left corner of the image, the satellite cloud map resolution is relatively high, and the overall color tone is better than Fengyun 4A
* The size of Fengyun 4A satellite cloud map does not exceed ***1MB***, and the size of Fengyun 4B satellite cloud map can reach up to ***20MB***. Choose the appropriate image source according to your own network environment

**2. Choose wallpaper ratio**
* **Fill screen:** The original image is scaled to the screen resolution, cropped and adjusted to the screen height
* **Original size:** The original image is scaled to the screen resolution, cropped and kept at 'original size'
* **Golden ratio:** The original image is scaled to the screen resolution, cropped and kept at a fixed aspect ratio, with a height adjusted to '0.618 times' of the screen height
* **Smaller size:** The original image is scaled to the screen resolution, cropped and kept at a fixed aspect ratio, with a height adjusted to '0.45 times' of the screen height

**3. Select image save location**
* The original image and the generated wallpaper image will be saved in this folder
* The maximum number of images saved in the folder is 96. After that, the oldest files will be deleted one by one, leaving 96 images

# Acknowledgements
* The core framework and GUI interface code for this project was generated by [**ChatGPT**](https://chat.openai.com/chat) (ChatGPT is indeed powerful, but there are also many problems with its generated code, so please use it carefully)
* The idea for this project came from [**wenkechen**](https://github.com/wenkechen)'s project [**MineEarth**](https://github.com/wenkechen/MineEarth). I used this program a few years ago, but there were some problems with it. The author has not updated it for a long time and only has "Himawari 8" as an image source. I personally wanted to have the Fengyun satellite image, so I created this project with the help of ChatGPT
* Some of the image processing code was referenced from [**Jiale685**](https://blog.csdn.net/L141210113/article/details/102642277?spm=1001.2014.3001.5506)'s project
