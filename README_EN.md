# Real-Time Satellite Cloud Map Wallpaper for Earth
[**简体中文**](README.md) | **English**

**Get real-time satellite cloud maps from "FY-4B" or the "GOES-R series", re-render the images, and generate a desktop wallpaper based on your current screen resolution**

GUI window of the software is shown below:

## Features
**1. Select Image Source**
* Choose **"FY-4B"**, **"GOES-East"**, or **"GOES-West"** as the image source
* FY-4B satellite cloud maps cover Asia, the western Pacific, the eastern Indian Ocean, and parts of Australia
* GOES-East satellite cloud maps cover North America, South America, and the Atlantic region
* GOES-West satellite cloud maps cover western North America and the eastern Pacific region
* The size of GOES-R series satellite cloud maps can reach up to ***20 MB***. Direct downloads from mainland China may be very slow. Choose an appropriate image source based on your network environment.
* Note: FY-4A satellite cloud maps have been officially discontinued, and their image source has been removed.

**2. Select Wallpaper Aspect Ratio**
* **Fill Screen:** Resize the original image to the screen resolution, crop it, and maintain the image aspect ratio while adjusting the height to match the screen height
* **Original Size:** Resize the original image to the screen resolution, crop it, and maintain the original size of the image
* **Golden Ratio:** Resize the original image to the screen resolution, crop it, and maintain the aspect ratio while adjusting the height to **0.618** of the screen height
* **Smaller Size:** Resize the original image to the screen resolution, crop it, and maintain the aspect ratio while adjusting the height to **0.45** of the screen height

**3. Select Image Save Location**
* Both the original images and generated wallpapers will be saved in this folder
* The folder stores a maximum of 96 images. If the number exceeds this limit, the oldest files will be deleted sequentially until 96 images remain
* ***Warning! Do not store other files in this folder, as exceeding 96 files will cause the oldest files to be deleted automatically!!!***

**4. Image Fetch Frequency**
* The wallpaper updates every time an image is fetched. The unit is in minutes.
* FY-4B satellite images are officially updated every 15 minutes. If "FY-4B" is selected as the image source, it is recommended to set the fetch frequency to **≥30 minutes**.
* GOES-R series satellite images are officially updated every 10 minutes. If "GOES-East" or "GOES-West" is selected as the image source, it is recommended to set the fetch frequency to **≥30 minutes**.

## Tips
* Click the **"Start"** button to automatically download satellite cloud maps and update the wallpaper at the set parameters and frequency.
* Click the **"Exit"** button to display a confirmation window. Click **"Confirm"** to fully exit the program.
* Click the **"Add/Remove Time Watermark"** button to add or remove a time watermark in the bottom-right corner of the wallpaper for easy reference to the update time.
* Click the **"Enable/Disable Startup"** button to enable or disable the program from starting automatically at system boot. If enabled, the program will start and update the wallpaper automatically without manually clicking **"Start"**.
* The **"Operation Log"** display box at the bottom of the main interface shows the program's runtime status.
* Closing the GUI window will keep the program running in the background. You can see the program icon in the system tray. Click the tray icon to restore the GUI window. Right-click the icon to open a menu and select options like **"Show Window"** or **"Exit Completely"**.

* This project was inspired by  [**wksama**](https://github.com/wksama)'s project [**MineEarth**](https://github.com/wenkechen/MineEarth). I previously used this program but encountered some issues. The author has not updated it for a long time, and the only available image source was "Himawari 8." With the help of AI, I created this project.
* Part of the image processing code was referenced from [**Jiale685**](https://blog.csdn.net/L141210113/article/details/102642277?spm=1001.2014.3001.5506)'s project.
